Musickit
========

An experiment in building a container app using Qt and Webkit that exposes a 
JS api for audio playback, using phonon, and potentially some other APIs
(XMPP etc) so that a music player can be written in JS/html and not suck.

--

I used QT Creator 4.6, it rocks, but I had to symlink my phonon qt plugin
dir into the place where creator got installed. Packaging/distro bug.
